An Android app that plays with Ravelry.com's APIs.

Current capabilities:

- find LYS, plot on Google map with links to web sites, phone #s and twitter feeds
- display your needle collection

In progress features:

- project list

GitHub's heuristics to the contrary, the app is written in Scala, not Java.

Thanks to the folks who made useful libraries with permissive licenses:
 - Cyril Mottier's GreenDroid UI library
 - Android-MapViewBalloons, by readyState Software
 - Doug Crockford's reference JSON implementation
 - Ben Biddington's OAuth.Coriander
